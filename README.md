TURING DataMart unlocks the value of data.

Data owners and consumers use TURING DataMart app to publish, discover, and consume data in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion. 

Datatokens wrap data services as industry-standard ERC20 tokens. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other decentralized finance (DeFi) tools.

## Data Marketplaces with Blockchain Superpowers

Use TURING DataMart to publish data, stake on data (curate), and buy data. Data is published as interoperable ERC20 datatokens. Compute-to-data enables private data to be bought & sold. 

#### Data Publishers

Monetize your data, while preserving privacy and control.

#### Data Consumers

Buy data that you couldnâ€™t get before: private data.

## Buy & Sell Private Data, While Preserving Privacy

Compute-to-data resolves the tradeoff between the benefits of using private data, and the risks of exposing it. It lets the data stay on-premise, yet allows 3rd parties to run specific compute jobs on it to get useful compute results like averaging or building an AI model.

## More Data, Provenance, and Earning Opportunities

As a data scientist or AI practitioner, you can benefit from access to more data (including private data), crypto-secured provenance in data & AI training, and income opportunities for selling data and curating data.

## More the data better the results

This app provides a decentralized ecosystem using which we can get access to more data . This enables us in leveraging more data for our AI models and getting better results.

## On-ramp and off-ramp for data assets into DeFi

This app makes it easy to publish data services (deploy and mint ERC20 datatokens), and to consume data services (spend datatokens). Crypto wallets, exchanges, and DAOs become data wallets, exchanges, and DAOs.

# To start local development:


```
git clone https://github.com/sudhanshu-shukla-git/market.git
cd market

#when using nvm to manage Node.js versions
nvm use

npm install

npm start
```
```

This will start the development server under
`http://localhost:8000`.

To explore the generated GraphQL data structure fire up the accompanying GraphiQL IDE under
`http://localhost:8000/__graphql`.
